## What to do during this test 📱👨🏼‍💻
1. Implement the forecastService in the ViewModel using decency injection
2. Display the day and description in the list
3. Implement swipe to the delete in the the list
4. Implement the navigation using the coordinator pattern
5. Create a detail view with code, design is up to you :) 👩🏽‍🎨 👨🏼‍🎨
